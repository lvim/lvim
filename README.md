# lvim
Vim/NeoVim plugins as packages.

Plugin with `lvim.lock` file is considered a package, where plugin dependecies are locked.

This project aims to manage dependencies of your vim / neovim configuration.

Your editor configuration may keep using any package manager as before, whilst `lvim` will take care of pinning plugins and their dependencies ensuring the stability of our editor config.
